# PRD: RESUME2WEBSITE V4 Project Cleanup
Created: 2025-07-13

## Objective
Perform a comprehensive cleanup of the RESUME2WEBSITE V4 project structure to improve maintainability, reduce clutter, and establish consistent organization patterns.

## Goals
1. Remove all unnecessary files and directories
2. Reorganize misplaced files to appropriate locations
3. Standardize naming conventions and configurations
4. Improve git performance and repository cleanliness
5. Ensure all cleanup actions are safe and verified

## Success Criteria
- Disk space saved: ~500MB+ 
- File count reduction: ~1000+ files
- All build artifacts removed from version control
- Consistent project structure following best practices
- No broken functionality after cleanup

## Requirements

### Phase 1: Analysis and Verification
- Inventory all files marked for deletion
- Verify no active code references deleted files
- Check for duplicate functionality between /legacy and /src
- Create backup branch before deletions
- Document all dependencies and references

### Phase 2: File Removal
- Remove all .DS_Store files
- Delete all .next build directories  
- Remove legacy Python files from root
- Clean up entire /legacy folder
- Remove duplicate package-lock.json files
- Clean test output files

### Phase 3: File Reorganization
- Move Python test scripts to proper locations
- Relocate utility scripts to /src/utils/scripts/
- Move shell scripts to /scripts/ at root
- Reorganize documentation to /docs/
- Consolidate test files into organized structure

### Phase 4: Standardization
- Rename untitled folders with descriptive names
- Standardize config file extensions (.js vs .mjs)
- Update .gitignore with proper entries
- Create cleanup automation script

### Phase 5: Validation
- Run all tests to ensure nothing broken
- Verify build processes work correctly
- Test both frontend and backend functionality
- Check git repository size reduction
- Document changes made

## Technical Details

### High Priority Actions
1. Remove all .next directories (9 found)
2. Delete entire /legacy/ folder after verification
3. Remove all .DS_Store files
4. Update .gitignore to prevent future issues

### Medium Priority Actions
1. Consolidate test files into /tests/ structure
2. Move scripts to appropriate locations
3. Clean up /data/uploads/ directory

### Low Priority Actions
1. Rename untitled folders
2. Standardize configuration file extensions
3. Consider database location changes

## Risks and Mitigation
- Risk: Deleting files still in use
  - Mitigation: Thorough reference checking before deletion
- Risk: Breaking build processes
  - Mitigation: Test builds after each major change
- Risk: Loss of important code
  - Mitigation: Create backup branch, verify duplicates

## Implementation Steps
1. Create comprehensive task list in TaskMaster
2. Execute tasks in phases with validation
3. Run tests after each phase
4. Document all changes
5. Create cleanup automation for future use
