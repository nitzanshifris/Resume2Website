        "description": "Enhance the existing LiveLogger system to automatically emit Server-Sent Events for all log entries, implement correlation IDs for cross-service tracking, add performance metrics collection capabilities, and create a log aggregation system for improved debugging.",
        "details": "## Implementation Overview\n\n### 1. LiveLogger SSE Integration\n- Modify the existing LiveLogger class to automatically emit SSE messages for every log event\n- Create a new `SSELogEmitter` class that:\n  ```typescript\n  class SSELogEmitter {\n    private sseConnections: Map<string, Response>;\n    \n    emit(logEntry: LogEntry) {\n      const sseMessage = this.formatSSEMessage(logEntry);\n      this.broadcast(sseMessage);\n    }\n    \n    private formatSSEMessage(entry: LogEntry): string {\n      return `event: log\\ndata: ${JSON.stringify({\n        timestamp: entry.timestamp,\n        level: entry.level,\n        message: entry.message,\n        correlationId: entry.correlationId,\n        metadata: entry.metadata\n      })}\\n\\n`;\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n### 2. Correlation ID Implementation\n- Generate unique correlation IDs using UUID v4 for each request/operation\n- Implement correlation ID propagation:\n  ```typescript\n  interface CorrelationContext {\n    correlationId: string;\n    parentId?: string;\n    spanId: string;\n    service: string;\n  }\n  \n  class CorrelationManager {\n    static createContext(parentId?: string): CorrelationContext {\n      return {\n        correlationId: parentId || uuidv4(),\n        parentId,\n        spanId: uuidv4(),\n        service: process.env.SERVICE_NAME || 'cv2web'\n      };\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n- Add correlation ID to all log entries automatically\n- Pass correlation IDs through HTTP headers for cross-service communication\n\n### 3. Performance Metrics Collection\n- Implement performance tracking decorators:\n  ```typescript\n  @measurePerformance()\n  async processCV(data: CVData): Promise<Result> {\n    // Method implementation\n  }\n  ```\n- Track key metrics:\n  - Method execution time\n  - Memory usage snapshots\n  - CPU utilization\n  - Request/response sizes\n  - Database query times\n- Emit performance data through SSE:\n  ```typescript\n  event: metrics\n  data: {\n    \"correlationId\": \"abc-123\",\n    \"operation\": \"cv.extraction\",\n    \"duration\": 1234,\n    \"memory\": { \"used\": 256, \"total\": 512 },\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-01T12:00:00Z\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n### 4. Log Aggregation System\n- Create centralized log storage using a time-series approach\n- Implement log buffering to batch writes for performance:\n  ```typescript\n  class LogAggregator {\n    private buffer: LogEntry[] = [];\n    private flushInterval = 5000; // 5 seconds\n    \n    async aggregate(entry: LogEntry) {\n      this.buffer.push(entry);\n      if (this.buffer.length >= 100) {\n        await this.flush();\n      }\n    }\n    \n    private async flush() {\n      // Batch insert to database\n      await db.logs.insertMany(this.buffer);\n      this.buffer = [];\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n- Create indexes on correlation ID, timestamp, and log level for efficient querying\n- Implement log retention policies (e.g., keep detailed logs for 7 days, aggregated logs for 30 days)\n\n### 5. Enhanced LiveLogger API\n- Extend LiveLogger with new methods:\n  ```typescript\n  class LiveLogger {\n    constructor(\n      private sseEmitter: SSELogEmitter,\n      private aggregator: LogAggregator,\n      private metricsCollector: MetricsCollector\n    ) {}\n    \n    async log(level: LogLevel, message: string, metadata?: any) {\n      const entry = this.createLogEntry(level, message, metadata);\n      \n      // Emit via SSE\n      this.sseEmitter.emit(entry);\n      \n      // Store in aggregation system\n      await this.aggregator.aggregate(entry);\n      \n      // Collect metrics if applicable\n      if (metadata?.metrics) {\n        this.metricsCollector.record(metadata.metrics);\n      }\n    }\n    \n    withCorrelation(correlationId: string): LiveLogger {\n      // Return a logger instance bound to specific correlation ID\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n### 6. SSE Message Types for Logging\nDefine standardized log event types:\n- `log:info` - Informational messages\n- `log:warning` - Warning messages\n- `log:error` - Error messages with stack traces\n- `log:debug` - Debug information (only in development)\n- `metrics` - Performance metrics\n- `correlation:start` - Beginning of correlated operation\n- `correlation:end` - End of correlated operation",

Template Architecture and Structure\n- Create a modular template system with customizable components:\n  ```typescript\n  interface Resume2WebTemplate {\n    metadata: {\n      name: 'Resume2Web Professional',\n      tier: '.90',\n      version: '1.0.0',\n      brandingLevel: 'full' | 'minimal' | 'custom'\n    };\n    components: {\n      header: HeaderComponent;\n      navigation: NavigationComponent;\n      sections: SectionComponent[];\n      footer: FooterComponent;\n    };\n    theme: ThemeConfiguration;\n  }\n  ```\n\n### 2. Resume2Web Branding Elements\n- Design and implement core brand assets:\n  ```typescript\n  const brandAssets = {\n    logo: {\n      primary: '/assets/resume2web-logo.svg',\n      secondary: '/assets/resume2web-icon.svg',\n      watermark: '/assets/resume2web-watermark.svg'\n    },\n    colors: {\n      primary: '#2563EB', // Professional blue\n      secondary: '#10B981', // Success green\n      accent: '#F59E0B', // Highlight amber\n      neutral: {\n        50: '#F9FAFB',\n        100: '#F3F4F6',\n        // ... full neutral palette\n      }\n    },\n    typography: {\n      headingFont: 'Inter, system-ui, sans-serif',\n      bodyFont: 'Inter, system-ui, sans-serif',\n      codeFont: 'JetBrains Mono, monospace'\n    }\n  };\n  ```\n\n### 3. Customizable Template Components\n\n#### Header Component with Branding\n```typescript\nconst HeaderComponent = {\n  layout: 'split' | 'centered' | 'minimal',\n  branding: {\n    showLogo: true,\n    logoPosition: 'left' | 'center',\n    tagline: 'Powered by Resume2Web',\n    customizable: true\n  },\n  userInfo: {\n    name: { fontSize: '3rem', weight: 700 },\n    title: { fontSize: '1.5rem', weight: 400 },\n    contact: { layout: 'horizontal' | 'vertical' }\n  }\n};\n```\n\n#### Section Templates\n- Create pre-designed section layouts:\n  ```typescript\n  const sectionTemplates = {\n    experience: {\n      layout: 'timeline' | 'cards' | 'minimal',\n      brandAccent: true,\n      animations: 'fade-in' | 'slide-up' | 'none'\n    },\n    skills: {\n      display: 'tags' | 'bars' | 'radar' | 'grid',\n      colorScheme: 'brand' | 'monochrome' | 'custom'\n    },\n    projects: {\n      layout: 'grid' | 'carousel' | 'list',\n      showThumbnails: true,\n      linkStyle: 'button' | 'inline' | 'card'\n    }\n  };\n  ```\n\n### 4. Theme Customization System\n- Implement theme variables with CSS custom properties:\n  ```css\n  :root {\n    /* Resume2Web Brand Colors */\n    --r2w-primary: #2563EB;\n    --r2w-primary-light: #3B82F6;\n    --r2w-primary-dark: #1D4ED8;\n    \n    /* User Customizable */\n    --user-accent: var(--r2w-primary);\n    --user-background: #FFFFFF;\n    --user-text: #1F2937;\n    \n    /* Layout Variables */\n    --r2w-max-width: 1200px;\n    --r2w-section-spacing: 4rem;\n    --r2w-border-radius: 0.5rem;\n  }\n  ```\n\n### 5. Responsive Design Implementation\n- Mobile-first approach with breakpoints:\n  ```scss\n  .r2w-template {\n    @media (max-width: 640px) {\n      .r2w-header { flex-direction: column; }\n      .r2w-section { padding: 2rem 1rem; }\n    }\n    \n    @media (min-width: 1024px) {\n      .r2w-container { \n        display: grid;\n        grid-template-columns: 300px 1fr;\n        gap: 3rem;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n### 6. Interactive Elements and Animations\n- Add subtle brand-aligned animations:\n  ```typescript\n  const animations = {\n    pageLoad: {\n      header: 'fadeInDown 0.6s ease-out',\n      sections: 'fadeInUp 0.8s ease-out',\n      stagger: '0.1s'\n    },\n    hover: {\n      scale: 1.02,\n      shadow: '0 10px 30px rgba(37, 99, 235, 0.1)'\n    },\n    scrollReveal: {\n      threshold: 0.1,\n      rootMargin: '0px 0px -100px 0px'\n    }\n  };\n  ```\n\n### 7. Template Configuration Interface\n- Create user-friendly customization options:\n  ```typescript\n  interface TemplateCustomization {\n    branding: {\n      level: 'full' | 'minimal' | 'hidden',\n      position: 'header' | 'footer' | 'watermark'\n    };\n    colors: {\n      useDefaults: boolean,\n      overrides: Partial<BrandColors>\n    };\n    layout: {\n      style: 'modern' | 'classic' | 'creative',\n      density: 'comfortable' | 'compact' | 'spacious'\n    };\n    features: {\n      animations: boolean,\n      darkMode: boolean,\n      printOptimized: boolean\n    };\n  }\n  ```\n\n### 8. Export and Build System\n- Template packaging for Go Live deployment:\n  ```typescript\n  const templateBuilder = {\n    async build(config: TemplateConfig) {\n      const html = await generateHTML(config);\n      const css = await compileStyles(config);\n      const assets = await optimizeAssets(config);\n      \n      return {\n        index: html,\n        styles: css,\n        assets: assets,\n        manifest: {\n          name: 'Resume2Web Professional',\n          version: '1.0.0',\n          tier: '.90'\n        }\n      };\n    }\n  };\n  ```",

'production' : 'preview',\n          key,\n          value,\n          target: [env]\n        });\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n### 5. Custom Domain Configuration\n- Implement automatic domain setup for users with custom domains:\n  ```typescript\n  async function configureDomain(projectId: string, domain: string) {\n    // 1. Add domain to project\n    const domainResponse = await vercelClient.v9.projects.addDomain({\n      projectId,\n      domain,\n    });\n    \n    // 2. Get DNS records for user configuration\n    const dnsRecords = await vercelClient.v6.domains.getDNSRecords({\n      domain,\n    });\n    \n    // 3. Return configuration instructions\n    return {\n      domain: domainResponse.domain,\n      dnsRecords,\n      verificationToken: domainResponse.verification?.value,\n      status: 'pending_verification'\n    };\n  }\n  ```\n\n### 6.

Performance and Load Tests\n- Test deployment service under load:\n  ```typescript\n  describe('Deployment Service Performance', () => {\n    it('should handle concurrent deployments', async () => {\n      const deployments = Array(10).fill(null).map((_, i) => \n        deploymentService.deployProject({\n          userId: `user${i}`,\n          sandboxId: `sandbox${i}`,\n          projectName: `portfolio${i}`\n        })\n      );\n      \n      const results = await Promise.allSettled(deployments);\n      const successful = results.filter(r => r.status === 'fulfilled');\n      \n      expect(successful.length).toBeGreaterThan(8); // Allow for some rate limiting\n    });\n  });\n  ```\n\n### 7. Security Tests\n- Verify secure handling of API tokens and environment variables:\n  ```typescript\n  describe('Security', () => {\n    it('should not expose Vercel API token in logs', async () => {\n      const logSpy = jest.spyOn(console, 'log');\n      \n      await deploymentService.deployProject(mockOptions);\n      \n      const logs = logSpy.mock.calls.flat().join(' ');\n      expect(logs).not.toContain(process.env.VERCEL_API_TOKEN);\n    });\n    \n    it('should sanitize user input for project names', async () => {\n      const maliciousName = '<script>alert(\"xss\")</script>';\n      const result = await deploymentService.deployProject({\n        ...mockOptions,\n        projectName: maliciousName\n      });\n      \n      expect(result.projectName).not.toContain('<script>');\n      expect(result.projectName).toMatch(/^[a-z0-9-]+$/);\n    });\n  });\n  ```",
