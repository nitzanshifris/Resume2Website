# Task ID: 1
# Title: Create backup branch before starting cleanup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a dedicated backup branch from the current main/master branch to preserve the existing codebase state before initiating any cleanup activities.
# Details:
This task involves creating a safety net before making potentially breaking changes during the cleanup process. Implementation steps:

1. Ensure your local repository is up to date:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git pull origin main  # or master, depending on your default branch
   ```

2. Create a new backup branch with a descriptive name and timestamp:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b backup/pre-cleanup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
   ```

3. Push the backup branch to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin backup/pre-cleanup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
   ```

4. Document the backup branch creation in the project's changelog or README:
   - Branch name
   - Creation date and time
   - Purpose (pre-cleanup backup)
   - Last commit hash before cleanup

5. Consider adding branch protection rules if your repository supports it:
   - Prevent deletion
   - Restrict push access
   - Require pull request reviews for any changes

6. Create a tag for easy reference:
   ```bash
   git tag -a pre-cleanup-backup -m "Backup before cleanup activities"
   git push origin pre-cleanup-backup
   ```

Best practices:
- Use a consistent naming convention for backup branches
- Include timestamps to track when backups were created
- Consider automating this process for future cleanup activities
- Ensure all team members are aware of the backup branch location

# Test Strategy:
Verify the backup branch creation with the following steps:

1. Confirm the backup branch exists locally:
   ```bash
   git branch | grep backup/pre-cleanup
   ```

2. Verify the branch was pushed to remote:
   ```bash
   git ls-remote --heads origin | grep backup/pre-cleanup
   ```

3. Check that the backup branch contains the exact same commit history as main/master:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -n 10 main
   git log --oneline -n 10 backup/pre-cleanup-[timestamp]
   ```
   Both outputs should be identical.

4. Verify the tag was created and pushed:
   ```bash
   git tag -l | grep pre-cleanup-backup
   git ls-remote --tags origin | grep pre-cleanup-backup
   ```

5. Test branch protection (if configured):
   - Attempt to delete the branch (should fail)
   - Try direct push to the branch (should be restricted)

6. Confirm documentation was updated:
   - Check changelog/README for backup branch information
   - Verify all required details are present (branch name, date, purpose, commit hash)

7. Perform a test restoration:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test-restore backup/pre-cleanup-[timestamp]
   ```
   Ensure all files and commit history are intact.

8. Clean up test branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git branch -d test-restore
   ```
