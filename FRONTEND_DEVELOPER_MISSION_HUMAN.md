# Portfolio Template Developer Brief

Hi! We need you to create a stunning portfolio template that transforms CV/resume data into something amazing. Here's what you need to know:

## The Mission 🎯
Build a Next.js portfolio template that takes structured CV data and displays it beautifully. Think of it as turning boring resume data into an interactive, memorable experience.

## What We'll Give You 📦
We'll inject a JSON file with extracted CV data. It includes things like:
- Personal info (name, title, photo)
- Contact details & social links
- Work experience & education
- Skills, projects, achievements
- Certifications, languages, hobbies
- And more...

(See `FRONTEND_DEVELOPER_DATA_CONTRACT.json` for the complete structure)

## Technical Stack 🛠
- Next.js 15+
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Fully responsive
- SEO optimized

## Key Requirements ✅
1. **Handle Missing Data**: Not all sections will have data - hide empty ones gracefully
2. **Create an Adapter**: Transform our data format to your template's needs
3. **Make it Memorable**: This should NOT look like a typical resume
4. **Performance**: Fast loading, optimized
5. **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines

## File Structure 📁
```

## Examples of What NOT to Do ❌
