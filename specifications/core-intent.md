# CV2WEB Core Intent Specification

*Version 1.0 - Living document that defines our fundamental values and intentions*

## Mission Statement

**CV2WEB exists to eliminate the "no" pile - transforming every job seeker's CV into a compelling portfolio that gets noticed.**

## Core Values

### CI01: User-Centric Value Creation
CV2WEB prioritizes genuine value for job seekers above all else. Every feature, every optimization, every decision must demonstrably improve a candidate's chances of getting hired.

### CI02: Preserve Human Intent  
We extract and present information exactly as the user intended. Never paraphrase, rewrite, or "improve" the user's language. Their words carry their personality and should be preserved authentically.

### CI03: Quality Over Speed
A portfolio that accurately represents the candidate is more valuable than a fast but inaccurate one. We optimize for correctness first, performance second.

### CI04: Accessibility and Inclusion
Job seeking is stressful enough. CV2WEB should work for everyone regardless of CV format, language proficiency, career stage, or technical skill level.

### CI05: Transparency and Trust
Users should always understand what's happening with their data. Progress should be clear, failures should be explained, and success should be measurable.

## Problem Statement

**The Challenge**: 
- 75% of CVs never get past initial screening
- Job seekers spend hours formatting instead of focusing on content
- Traditional CVs fail to showcase skills effectively in digital hiring processes
- Career changers and non-traditional backgrounds get overlooked

**Our Solution**:
Transform static CVs into dynamic, engaging portfolios that tell the complete career story.

## Success Philosophy

### CI06: Measurable Impact
Success is measured by user outcomes, not technical metrics:
- Do users get more interviews?
- Do hiring managers spend more time reviewing their profiles?
- Do candidates feel more confident in their presentation?

### CI07: Compound Value
Each interaction should improve the system for all users. Better extraction leads to better portfolios. Better portfolios create better feedback loops.

### CI08: Sustainable Growth
Growth through user value, not manipulation. Users should recommend CV2WEB because it genuinely helped them, not because of dark patterns or artificial incentives.

## Quality Standards

### CI09: Extraction Accuracy
- 95%+ accuracy on core biographical information
- 90%+ accuracy on experience and education details  
- 85%+ accuracy on skills and achievements
- Zero tolerance for fabricated information

### CI10: Portfolio Quality
- Professional appearance suitable for any industry
- Mobile-responsive and accessible design
- Fast loading times (<3 seconds)
- Accurate reflection of extracted data

### CI11: User Experience
- Intuitive flow requiring minimal explanation
- Clear progress indication during processing
- Helpful error messages with actionable guidance
- Consistent performance across devices and file formats

## Constraints and Boundaries

### CI12: Privacy Protection
User data is sacred. It belongs to the user, not to CV2WEB. Data processing is for the user's direct benefit only, never for secondary purposes without explicit consent.

### CI13: Professional Standards
All generated portfolios must meet professional presentation standards suitable for corporate environments, while allowing personality to show through authentic content.

### CI14: Technical Reliability  
System should gracefully handle edge cases, provide meaningful error recovery, and maintain consistent performance under load.
