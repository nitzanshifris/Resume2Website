description: Create a new feature with TaskMaster PRD and task generation
---

I'll help you create **$ARGUMENTS** using TaskMaster for structured development.

Let me start by creating a comprehensive PRD based on the feature name. I'll make reasonable assumptions and you can correct me if needed.

!echo "Starting TaskMaster workflow for: $ARGUMENTS"

## Creating PRD for $ARGUMENTS

!mkdir -p .taskmaster/docs

Now I'll create a Product Requirements Document for $ARGUMENTS and then:
1. Generate tasks from the PRD
2. Analyze task complexity
3. Break down complex tasks
4. Start implementation

Please provide any specific requirements or I'll proceed with standard implementation.
