# Creating PRD for: $ARGUMENTS

!mkdir -p .taskmaster/docs

I'll create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document based on the feature name and context.

## PRD Structure:
1. Overview & Objectives
2. Core Features
3. Technical Requirements
4. User Experience
5. Success Criteria
6. Implementation Plan

Creating the PRD file now...

After the PRD is created, I'll:
- Parse it to generate tasks
- Analyze complexity
- Show you the task list

Please wait while I create the PRD...
