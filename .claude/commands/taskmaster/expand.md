Breaking down task $ARGUMENTS into subtasks.

First, let me check the current task:
!taskmaster show --id=$ARGUMENTS

I'll analyze the complexity and create 4-6 subtasks to make implementation more manageable.

Please provide specific areas to focus on, or I'll use my analysis to determine the best breakdown.
