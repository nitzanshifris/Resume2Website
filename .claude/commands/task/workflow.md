# TaskMaster Workflow: $ARGUMENTS

I'll guide you through the complete TaskMaster workflow for **$ARGUMENTS**.

## Step 1: Create PRD
First, I'll create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document.

!mkdir -p .taskmaster/docs

Creating PRD file at `.taskmaster/docs/${ARGUMENTS// /-}-prd.txt`...

## Step 2: Generate Tasks
After creating the PRD, I'll parse it to generate tasks.

## Step 3: Analyze Complexity
Then analyze which tasks need to be broken down.

## Step 4: Execute
Finally, we'll start implementing tasks one by one.

What specific requirements do you have for $ARGUMENTS?
