description: Create a new feature with TaskMaster PRD and task generation
---

I'll help you create $ARGUMENTS using TaskMaster for structured development.

First, let me gather requirements:

1. What are the main objectives for $ARGUMENTS?
2. What are the technical requirements or constraints?
3. Are there any specific libraries or patterns you want to use?

After understanding your requirements, I'll:
1. Create a comprehensive PRD
2. Generate and analyze tasks
3. Break down complex tasks
4. Start systematic implementation
